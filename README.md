# Assignment_6
# Text Frequency Analyzer

## Overview
This project, developed for the web development course at SFSU, is a web application that dynamically analyzes text inputted by users to determine and display the frequency of the most common words. The core functionality of the application is built using plain JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, emphasizing DOM manipulation and local storage usage.

## Features
- **Dynamic Content Creation**: All UI elements such as the textarea and the submit button are created and managed through JavaScript, ensuring flexibility and reducing static content in the HTML file.
- **Text Analysis**: Users can input text into a dynamically created textarea. Upon submission, the text is processed, tokenized, and analyzed to calculate the frequency of each word.
- **Display Results**: The frequencies of the top five most common words are displayed in a table format, sorted by frequency and, in case of ties, alphabetically.

## Technical Details
- The application only includes a single HTML element (`<div id="root"></div>`) within the body of the `index.html`, as required.
- JavaScript is used for creating all additional HTML elements dynamically and managing them.
- CSS is employed to style the page, making the interface user-friendly and visually appealing.
- Console logging is implemented to facilitate easy grading by showing the word frequency counts directly in the browser's developer tools.

## Learning Journey
During this project, I enhanced my understanding of the Document Object Model (DOM) and how to manipulate it using JavaScript. I learned how to effectively use local storage to create persistent user-specific data. Additionally, the project allowed me to refine my skills in organizing and documenting code, ensuring readability and maintainability.
